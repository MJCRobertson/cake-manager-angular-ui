# CakeManagerUi

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.1.0.

This is the front end client application to accompany the Cake Manager API Micro Service.

Once the Github project has been cloned to your local machine, navigate to the command line and in the root folder of the project
run the ~ $ ng serve ~ command, this will launch the application on localhost:4200.

The following URL's can be used to navigate the UI

  - This will access the page for cake creation http://localhost:4200/admin
  - This page has a list of all cakes in the system http://localhost:4200/admin

  You can also access server endpoints by adding on /server and then one of the server paths from the Cake Manager API service 

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
